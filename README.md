# Scribo
Lightweight email-viewing app that shows you your unread emails and stars (‚≠ê) the ones it classifies as the most important using Gaussian Naive Bayes model.
Summaries and a to-do can be generated for each email (GeminiAI) to copy and paste into your to-do list of choice (like Notion).

Eliminate the clutter in your email and make email-viewing streamlined.
